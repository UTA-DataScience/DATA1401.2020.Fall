        "   \n",
        "   - You can search a test file using the \"grep\" command, which takes a string keyword as the first argument and a filename as the second, and by default prints out every line in the file that contrains the string. So for example you can do \"grep \\$USER /etc/passwd\" to find the line corresponding to your account. Some useful flags: \n",
